# AC31009-Games-Programming-Coursework
Re-upload of coursework that was submitted for my university module AC31009.

This was originally submitted as part of coursework in May 2021 for my university module; Games Programming. 

**Tech Stack**
* Frontend: React.js
* Backend: Node.js
* Database: MongoDB
* Also used: Socket.io (needed to use to pass a segment in the coursework marking sheet)

A **LIVE and working version of this code did exist**, but **only the frontend of it is still working**, and can be found below. It should be noted that the backend does not work, so the LIVE version of the code will not work as expected. There have been no issues I've identified so far with the local version of the code, so I welcome you to download and run this for yourself if you know how to. 

* LIVE Website:

The re-upload is for historical and portfolio purposes only. 

The project was not originally completed using GitHub due to the restrictions imposed on us in the form of the marking sheet for the coursework.
